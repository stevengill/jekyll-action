# Using TypeScript

This project is written and built using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which means many of the APIs have type information metadata ðŸŽ‰. If youâ€™re using a code editor like VSCode, Atom, or many others that know how to read that metadata, or if youâ€™re using TypeScript in your own project, youâ€™ll benefit from improved documentation as your write code, early detection of errors, easier refactoring, and more.

This page helps describe how to use this package from a project that also uses TypeScript.

### Minimum version

The latest major version of `@slack/bolt` is supported to build against a minimum TypeScript version of v3.7.
